# meteor-instagram-api
This is the Meteor javascript framework with the Instagram API.


User searches Instagram by hashtag inputed from a form. The requested instagram data is called from the server, saved to a Collection, and then displayed in a template. 

You will need the following for this code to work: 
1. Install the 'http' package from  https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/http
2. An access token from https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/
3. Remove 'autopublish' package. Otherwise publication/subscription functions will not work. 

Unnecessary Bits: 
The CSS file is from http://getskeleton.com/ it is not necessary.
There are two packages 'Collections2' and 'meteorhacks' which are also not necessary for this code.
